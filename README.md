A Pumpkin-shaped lamp using WS2812b LED modules and the cheapest STM32 I could find on Digikey.

The timings are generated - and data fed fast enough - by using the DMA and abusing the SPI (See 2022 Pumpkin Code for details).

Due to component shortages the FTDI USB chip was never fitted or tested by me, although someone told me they tried it and it didn't work - so beware of that.
